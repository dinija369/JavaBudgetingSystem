# JavaBudgetingSystem
Hello. This is my first Java project. It is a budgeting system for companies. It runs in console. The project allows the user to choose if they want to use the application in a team mode or in a manager mode. If team mode is selected the application will ask for a username and password and to add a team and supervisor for a budgeting profile. Once in the application the user can choose to add allowance, add expense, see reports, and edit profile of the team. The allowance and money spent is printed on the home screen. If manager mode has been selected the user will be asked to either log in or register. The manager mode profile can add teams, approve expenses, and edit profile. If a team is added it will be visible on the manager home screen and can be accessed from the home screen.
In the future I would like to add a Microsoft SQL server functionality to this application.
